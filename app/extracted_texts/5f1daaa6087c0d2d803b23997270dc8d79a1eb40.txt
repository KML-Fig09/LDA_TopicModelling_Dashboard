1. INTRODUCTION

In our third year of producing , we can report steady progress in closing data 
gaps across most humanitarian operations. This momentum is the result of global advocacy and investment 
paired with field-level data sharing and outreach. Although the demand for data following the onset of the 
COVID-19 pandemic has peaked, it remains strong. 
Our understanding of data availability and use comes from managing the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), an 
open platform for finding and sharing data across crises and organizations.1 The data on HDX reflects the reality of 
the world’s worst humanitarian emergencies, from persistent displacement to a lack of food and shelter for 
vulnerable populations. The data also shows the response to these crises, from who is providing what assistance 
to funding levels and more. The UN estimates that 274 million people will need humanitarian assistance and 
protection in 2022, at a cost of US$41 billion. 
In 2021, HDX was used by 1.4 million people in 236 countries and territories, maintaining the growth we saw in 
2020. Organizations added 2,071 new datasets to the platform, bringing the total to almost 18,500 datasets, which 
were downloaded over 1.8 million times. Although HDX includes data about all countries in the world, we 
concentrate here on 27 locations with Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs).2 In 2021, 35 percent of all datasets 
downloaded from HDX were related to an HRP location.3
At the start of 2022, we estimate that 69 percent of relevant, complete crisis data is available across 27 
humanitarian operations, based on the analysis of the Data Grids. If we add the data that is relevant but 
incomplete, the total is 89 percent. This leaves 11 percent of categories with data that does not meet the criteria or 
with no data. The 27 Data Grids include 482 unique datasets, with a range of 12-22 datasets per location. 
https://data.humdata.org/ 
HRPs are prepared by UN Humanitarian Country Teams in locations where there is an ongoing humanitarian emergency. HRPs are generally 
prepared annually, and outline an overall strategy and specific activities for each humanitarian cluster or sector.
We use Mixpanel, a third-party analytics service, to understand the behavior of users on the HDX platform. We do not send identifying information 
to Mixpanel.

This report contains details on the data available for each location, category and sub-category covered in the Data 
Grids as of 31 December 2021. It includes a country deep-dive for Somalia and showcases the work of  the United 
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) on population statistics. It also has an assessment of the data required for 
modelling, specifically for developing anticipatory action trigger mechanisms, with examples from Ethiopia, 
Malawi, Nepal and the Philippines.

The HDX Data Grids narrow the focus within each HRP location to a limited set of foundational data needed to 
understand a humanitarian context. They provide a comparable way to assess data availability across locations and 
categories and are the basis for the analysis in this report. 
The Data Grids include six categories: aﬀected people; coordination and context; food security and nutrition; 
geography and infrastructure; health and education; and population and socio-economy. (See Annex A for definitions.) 
Data may be included in a Data Grid if it is relevant to the category and sub-national. The data is considered ‘complete’ 
if it has broad geographic coverage, is shared in a commonly used format, and is up-to-date. If any of those criteria are 
not met, then it is considered ‘incomplete’. The sub-category is complete if it includes at least one dataset that is 
complete. If the sub-category contains only incomplete datasets, then that sub-category is considered  incomplete. A 
sub-category is empty if no data meets the above criteria or the data does not exist on HDX. (See Annex B for the Data 
Grid criteria and curation process.)
 
In 2021, HDX maintained Data Grids for 27 locations and 21 sub-categories. The 27 locations are consistent with 2020, 
but the number of sub-categories decreased by six. Six were merged into three due to overlapping datasets and three 
were removed due to a lack of relevance across all locations. (See Annex C for changes to the Data Grids.)
We recognize the valuable contributions of all data-sharing organizations publishing data on HDX, and in 
particular the 20 organizations that populate the Data Grids, with reference to 125 data sources. Datasets included 
in the Data Grids are downloaded almost four times more than the average dataset on HDX. Trusted partnerships 
and focused advocacy eﬀorts have led to many new or updated datasets in the Data Grids this year, including: 
    • Sex and age disaggregated population statistics for Burundi with updated projections for 2021, contributed by 
UNFPA and sourced to the National Statistics Oﬀice.4 (See more on this type of data in Section 8.)
    • The number of health facilities and their functionality by province in Afghanistan, contributed by OCHA 
Afghanistan and sourced to WHO. The location of the health facilities is not provided due to the sensitivity of 
this data.5
    • The number of registered internally displaced people (IDPs) in Burkina Faso at the commune, province and 
regional level with gender and age breakdown, contributed by OCHA Burkina Faso and sourced to the Conseil 
National de Secours d’Urgence et de Réhabilitation.6
    • The location of schools and their status by commune in Mali, contributed by OCHA Mali on behalf of the 
Ministry of Education.7
    • Transportation status of roads in the Central African Republic (CAR) indicating the level of diﬀiculty for types of 
vehicles, contributed by OCHA CAR and compiled by UNDP.8
    • Joint severity analysis by sector at the district level for Zimbabwe, via OCHA ROSEA on behalf of multiple 
humanitarian partners.9

We hope that our analysis will increase awareness of the data available for humanitarian response activities and 
draw attention to what is missing within a critical subset of data. Humanitarian crises are dynamic and so is the 
data needed to understand them. The HDX team will continue to be strong data advocates and work in 
partnership with the dozens of organizations contributing and using data on the platform. We look forward to 
continued collaboration and to closing data gaps.
2. KEY MESSAGES
   • Progress is being made in closing data gaps across most humanitarian operations. This momentum is the 
result of global advocacy and investment paired with field-level data sharing and outreach. 
   • Although the demand for data following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has peaked, it remains strong. In 
2021, HDX was used by 1.4 million people in 236 countries and territories. Around 1.8 million datasets were 
downloaded. 
   • We estimate that 69 percent or over two-thirds of relevant, complete crisis data is available across 27 
locations with humanitarian operations, based on the analysis of the HDX Data Grids. If we add the data that 
is relevant but incomplete, the total is 89 percent. This leaves about 11 percent of the Data Grids with no data. 
   • Afghanistan (86 percent) and CAR (86 percent) have the most complete Data Grids. The next most complete 
locations are Chad (81 percent), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (81 percent), and Sudan (81 
percent). 
   • Venezuela (43 percent of the sub-categories with no data), Colombia (24 percent of the sub-categories with no 
data) and Libya (19 percent of the sub-categories with no data) are the countries with the largest data gaps.
   • Significant improvements were made with the availability of acute malnutrition data (from 19 to 73 percent 
complete). This is due to outreach with local partners by OCHA field oﬀices.
   • Datasets included in the Data Grids are downloaded almost four times more than the average dataset on HDX. 
Ethiopia is the most popular location and geography and infrastructure is the most popular category (as 
measured by total dataset downloads). The top five user locations were the United States, Pakistan, the 
United Kingdom, Ethiopia and Nigeria.
   • Humanitarian crises are dynamic and so is the data needed to understand them. The availability and 
completeness of data will fluctuate year-to-year as new data requirements come into focus. Since 2019, we 
have seen an increase in data completeness from 54 percent to 69 percent and the categories with no data fall 
from 25 percent to 11 percent (see chart below).
   • A priority for 2022 will be improving access to forecast, observational and impact data about hazards and 
shocks. This will be essential to expanding anticipatory action frameworks to more countries with 
humanitarian operations. To give momentum to these eﬀorts, we will create a new category in the HDX Data 
Grids.

We call on partners to generate and share data that is missing or incomplete for many humanitarian crises, 
including:
   • The location of education facilities (potential sources: national governments, UNICEF, Education Cluster).
   • The location of health facilities (potential sources: national governments, Health Cluster, WHO).
   • Local transportation routes with an indication of status (potential sources: national governments, WFP, 
Logistics Cluster).
   • Reference lists of historical hazards and their impact on vulnerable populations (potential sources: national 
governments, humanitarian agencies, UNDRR, researchers).
   • Hazard forecast and observational data (potential sources: national governments, regional climate service 
providers, researchers). 
In cases where data is sensitive, organizations can use HDX Connect¹⁰ to share only the metadata and make the 
underlying data available by request. Alternatively, an incomplete or aggregated version of the dataset that 
removes sensitive information (such as locations) can be shared publicly.¹¹

Given that the Data Grids became more complete over the course of 2021 (from 51 percent to 69 percent), we can 
see improvements across location, category and sub-category. Five countries – Burkina Faso, Burundi, DRC, CAR 
and Sudan – no longer have any sub-categories with missing data. The categories with the most improvement are 
aﬀected people and population and socio-economy. Overall, the sub-categories with no data have decreased 
from 25 percent to 11 percent year on year.

Afghanistan and CAR share the highest degree of data completeness at 86 percent. While both locations have 
incomplete sub-categories, Afghanistan has no data for transportation status in the coordination and context 
category.
The next most-complete locations for data are Chad (81 percent), DRC (81 percent) and Sudan (81 percent), all of 
which saw improvements from previous years. Venezuela (43 percent of the sub-categories with no data), 
Colombia (24 percent of the sub-categories with no data) and Libya (19 percent of the sub-categories with no data) 
are the countries with the largest data gaps. 
The most complete categories are aﬀected people (91 percent), population and socio-economy (90 percent) and 
food security and nutrition (81 percent). Health and education is the least complete category at 46 percent, owing 
to incomplete data for the location of health and education facilities. The most popular category, in terms of total 
dataset downloads, is geography and infrastructure.
A total of 482 unique datasets are included on the Data Grids. With 21 sub-categories, we would expect a complete 
Data Grid to include between 21-28 datasets. For the 27 locations covered in this report, the Data Grids include 
between 12 to 22 datasets.

6. COMPLETENESS BY LOCATION AND SUB-CATEGORY
The most complete sub-category is funding, followed by IDPs, refugees and persons of concern, humanitarian 
needs, food prices, and administrative divisions (all 96 percent complete), owing to the contributions of OCHA, 
IOM, UNHCR and WFP.
Transportation status (empty in 15 locations) and aﬀected areas (empty in 10 locations) are the most challenging 
sub-categories to fill. For transportation status, the data should include local transportation routes (e.g., roads, 
railways, ports) and their current accessibility but the data shared is mostly limited to roads. The aﬀected areas 
sub-category is filled when there is data on the impact of a rapid onset weather event or on the severity analysis 
of a Humanitarian Needs Overview.

There was significant improvement in the geography and infrastructure category which moved from 40 percent to 
67 percent complete due to better maintained data for administrative divisions and populated places.
This view of the Data Grids also shows where data is consistently (and centrally) shared across all locations but is 
considered incomplete (e.g., airports, education facilities, humanitarian access and conflict events). This is the 
case for secondary or crowd-sourced data that may not be the best available or is limited in coverage.

Transportation Status
There has been steady progress with the Somalia Data Grid over the past year. Overall data completeness 
improved from 56 percent to 76 percent, with only one sub-category missing data (populated places). The 
Somalia Data Grid includes 19 datasets shared by 10 organizations. Together, these datasets were downloaded 
6,411 times in 2021. The most popular dataset is the Somalia administrative boundaries. 
Somalia has two complete categories: aﬀected people, and food security and nutrition. The Food Security and 
Nutrition Analysis Unit at FAO newly shared data (via the Somalia Nutrition Cluster) on acute malnutrition by 
district. Other new additions to this Data Grid are the location of airstrips from the Logistics Cluster and 
transportation status from WFP. The OCHA Somalia oﬀice has played an important role in engaging local partners 
on data sharing and maintenance, with positive results.

8. ORGANIZATION DEEP DIVE: UNITED NATIONS POPULATION FUND
Population statistics are the starting point for estimating the number of people aﬀected by a humanitarian crisis. 
As part of its reproductive health mission, UNFPA works to strengthen national population data systems. Over the 
last several years, UNFPA and OCHA have partnered to ensure that sex and age disaggregated population data is 
accessible to the humanitarian community, and we can see the progress by looking at HDX.
The data collaboration with UNFPA is focused on countries experiencing or at risk of a humanitarian crisis. For 
these locations, OCHA oversees the common operational datasets (CODs), which are authoritative reference data 
used to support operations and decision-making in a humanitarian emergency.    The CODs include administrative 
boundaries, which are part of the geography and infrastructure category of the HDX Data Grids, and population 
statistics, which are part of the population and socio-economy category.
In 2021, UNFPA became the lead agency for the COD population statistics datasets. They combine demographic 
expertise with working relationships with national statistical agencies to identify, validate, and if necessary project 
the best available statistics. These datasets are given a ‘reference year’ referring to the year for which the data was 
originally collected (normally a census year) or to which it has been projected.
UNFPA began sharing COD population statistics on HDX in late 2020.   Over the past year, 50 datasets have been 
added covering 49 countries. Five of these datasets are included in the Data Grids for Burundi, Chad, Myanmar, 
Nigeria and Zimbabwe. The rest of UNFPA's current population datasets on HDX are for non-HRP locations that 
may be at risk of a humanitarian crisis. In 2022, UNFPA plans to update population datasets for sudden onset 
crises (as they did for Tonga following the recent volcanic eruption   ) and will continue projecting the oldest 
census data to the current year.
See the IASC Guidelines for Common Operational Datasets in Disaster Preparedness and Response (2010) for more details. The CODs are managed 
at the global level by OCHA’s Field Information Services Section and at the field level by OCHA Information Management Oﬀicers in consultation 
with Information Management Working Groups.
CODs also include humanitarian profile datasets, which are established afer the onset of a crisis and include the location of displaced people, 
and country-specific CODs which have local relevance.

essential for conducting needs 
assessments and for developing a 
humanitarian response plan.
Overall, the UNFPA data on HDX was 
downloaded over 7,000 times in 2021. 
The Nigeria population statistics 
dataset was the most popular, followed 
by Burundi and Zimbabwe, both of 
which were recently updated with 
projections for 2021. The datasets have 
been designed to join easily with the 
corresponding COD administrative 
boundaries, using established P-codes.

9. CONTRIBUTING ORGANIZATIONS

Out of the 298 organizations sharing data on HDX, 20 contribute data that is included in the Data Grids.   This is a 
reduction in the number of organizations from past years, mainly due to a decrease in the number of Data Grid 
sub-categories (from 27 to 21). An organization’s dataset may also be removed from the Data Grids if it is no longer 
timely or has been superseded by a more relevant dataset. The 20 contributing organizations are sharing data 
from about 125 sources.
OCHA is counted as a single organization even though 31 field oﬀices   and two entities at Headquarters contribute 
data to HDX. In total, OCHA field oﬀices contributed 185 datasets or 38 percent of all data in the Data Grids. For 
each HRP location, the OCHA oﬀice almost always contributes the top downloaded data. For total downloads 
across all 27 locations, the data from OCHA’s Financial Tracking Service (FTS) and IOM are the most popular.
Since 2015, the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) has shared important data on conflict events 
for almost 200 locations around the world. In 2021, ACLED changed the frequency of the data they make available 
on HDX from daily to weekly. The data now has the total number of reported political violence, civilian-targeting, 
and demonstration events per week, per country. ACLED makes the real-time datasets available through a 
registration process on their website.

An organization on HDX can be a legal entity or an informal group and may be listed as the source or the contributor of the dataset. The entities listed in 
this section have created organizations on HDX and manage their data directly. Although most organizations are both the source and contributor for the 
data, there are cases where this varies. For instance, as part of its coordination role, OCHA aggregates and shares data on humanitarian needs but the data 
is collected by multiple partners.

10. DATA FOR MODELLING: ANTICIPATORY ACTION
The Centre for Humanitarian Data   centre.humdata.org    |    Join our mailing list   bit.ly/humdatamailing    |    Twitter   @humdata    |    Email   centrehumdata@un.org 
Anticipatory action enables humanitarian organizations to provide assistance before a shock occurs, reducing the 
impact of a crisis on the lives of aﬀected people. Since early 2020, OCHA has been testing the practicalities of 
anticipatory action through pilots in 12 countries.   Each pilot has an anticipatory action framework with three 
elements: a forecast-based trigger mechanism embedded in a decision-making process (the model); a pre-agreed 
action plan (the delivery); and pre-arranged finance (the money, in this case from the UN Central Emergency 
Response Fund).
The Centre’s predictive analytics team has been supporting this work through the development of the trigger 
mechanisms. A trigger mechanism translates the characteristics of a hazard or a shock and its impact (food 
insecurity or damaged housing) into technical specifications.   These specifications are the basis for the action 
plan’s preemptive response. 
Triggers can include both observational data, such as water levels, and predictive elements, such as flood 
forecasts. A trigger is designed to provide partners with a window of opportunity to take action while balancing 
the uncertainty of the forecasts.
Designing a trigger requires access to three types of data:
 
 
1. Current and historical data about the hazard;
 
2. Data about the historical and expected impact of the hazard and shock; and
 
3. Hazard forecast data.
Despite progress in filling data gaps in 2021, the availability and usability of this type of data remains a major 
barrier to implementing anticipatory action in many humanitarian contexts. There has been suﬀicient data for 
the existing OCHA pilots but expanding anticipatory action to new HRP locations will be challenging without 
improvements to the data landscape.
Below we provide a closer look at the data needed for developing triggers based on our experience with several 
countries, including Ethiopia, Malawi, Nepal and the Philippines. While we touch on the DRC and Mozambique, 
the work to anticipate cholera is ongoing so we have not included these countries in the data availability table.
1. Hazard Data
Current and historical data about a hazard is required to model the likelihood of the event occurring. This data 
includes weather and climate observations and disease surveillance, as well as lists of recorded historical events, 
which are ofen incomplete or hard to access.  
In Ethiopia, for example, despite the number of actors producing early warning analysis for drought in the Horn 
of Africa, there is no consensus on the exact definition of what should be considered a drought. As a result, there 
was no agreed-upon reference list of historical drought years, which was needed to establish a trigger threshold 
and assess its performance.
Similarly, in Malawi, there was no reference dataset to understand the frequency and patterns of dry spells 
aﬀecting the southern region of the country, primarily due to a lack of consensus around the definition of the 
shock. To fill this gap, we have analyzed and made available on HDX    over 20 years of historical sub-national 
rainfall data to better understand when and where dry spells took place.
 
The 12 pilots are: Bangladesh (floods), Burkina Faso (drought), Chad (drought), DRC (cholera), Ethiopia (drought), Madagascar (plague), Malawi 
(dry spells), Mozambique (cholera), Nepal (floods), Niger (drought), Somalia (drought), and The Philippines (typhoons).
In this report we refer to ‘hazard’ as the potential source of harm (e.g., a flood) which generates a ‘shock’ (e.g., water level above a certain 
threshold) that has an impact on vulnerable people (e.g., crop losses or housing destruction).
To evaluate the trigger we used historical rainfall data and food security data. The Ethiopia trigger has been independently evaluated by the Red 
Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gR1NrqO9v0ktvTiuwC3seSqPOfjXdxUC/view

For anticipating cholera in the DRC and Mozambique, it was challenging to find datasets listing all past outbreaks. 
When the data was available, it was provided in multiple PDF reports, requiring significant eﬀort to make it usable 
for analysis.
2. Impact Data
Data linking previous shocks to their impact on vulnerable populations is essential for the design of an anticipatory 
action trigger. With this data in hand, it is possible to model the expected impact of a future shock.
In the Philippines, historical data on housing damage from previous typhoons was foundational for developing 
an impact model based on forecasted typhoon tracks. In Nepal, the list of historical floods was estimated using 
data on water levels but it was diﬀicult to estimate the severity of these events (i.e., the number of people aﬀected 
or the houses destroyed by the flood). In Malawi, OCHA conducted a survey and interviews to better understand 
the impact of past dry spells.
Access to impact data is one of the main limitations in implementing anticipatory action in countries with 
humanitarian operations. There are consistent gaps in data on the impact of hazards on vulnerable populations. 
Even when this data is available, it is unlikely to be machine readable, sub-national and/or include relevant 
geographic coverage. 
These findings correspond with the completeness levels of the aﬀected areas sub-category in the Data Grids, 
where 10 out of the 27 HRP locations are missing data. Where this data does exist, it may only refer to a recent 
shock (i.e., a flood in South Sudan   ) or be part of a broader severity analysis conducted for the Humanitarian 
Needs Overview process.
3. Forecast Data 
Current forecast data is provided globally, with projections for riverine floods, seasonal rainfall forecasts, or major 
storms; or at the regional and national level, with projections for specific countries or areas. In addition, historical 
forecasts are used to better understand model performance and the lead time that these models could provide as 
part of an anticipatory action plan.
Accessing forecast data in a machine-readable format is a challenge. In the Philippines, we relied on global data 
providers. In Nepal, national authorities provided qualitative flood early warning information, which had to be 
extracted and translated from social media and the Government’s website. The challenge can be even greater 
when looking for historical forecast data. It is either not available or has very limited geographic or temporal 
coverage. For Nepal, we found that national authorities did not keep a record of historical flood forecasts, which 
was needed to evaluate the forecasting skills and lead time of the model.

Improving Access to Hazard Data
The anticipatory action pilots have demonstrated the promise of getting ahead of crises before they escalate by 
using diﬀerent analytical approaches to predict out-of-the-ordinary events and their projected impact on 
vulnerable people. This approach is enabled by the growing availability and quality of forecast data as well as the 
increasing awareness of humanitarian actors of the opportunities it provides.
Access to forecast, observational and impact data about hazards and shocks will be essential to expanding 
anticipatory action frameworks to more countries with humanitarian operations. To help humanitarian actors 
better assess the feasibility of anticipatory action in diﬀerent contexts, the Centre is developing a checklist for 
trigger mechanisms. This will include data requirements in addition to other factors such as local capacity and 
monitoring. 
Beyond anticipatory action, more robust weather and climate data is needed to understand the near and 
medium-term eﬀects of the climate crisis on humanitarian operations. Access to relevant data and evidence about 
the humanitarian impacts of climate change is key to helping extend the annual time horizon humanitarians 
typically focus on. 
To give momentum to these eﬀorts, we will create a new category in the HDX Data Grids that includes the types of 
data detailed above. We will also work with researchers to fill known data gaps by developing reference lists of 
historical hazards and their impact for priority countries.

11. CONCLUSION
We will continue to update the Data Grids throughout the year as organizations share new, relevant data. The 
current status for each location is always available on HDX, both on the relevant location page and on the 
Overview of Data Grids page.   As part of our internal Data Grid Governance Group, we will regularly review the 
categories and sub-categories to see if they should be removed or expanded. A priority for 2022 will be improving 
access to forecast, observational and impact data about hazards and shocks for anticipatory action. We welcome 
feedback on possible improvements. Please be in touch with questions or comments at centrehumdata@un.org.

ANNEX B: INCLUSION OF DATA IN THE DATA GRIDS
Data Grid curation involves the careful evaluation of datasets on HDX for inclusion in one or more of the 
sub-categories in accordance with a standard criteria. The HDX team conducts this evaluation when a dataset is 
newly added or updated on HDX. 
The HDX team supports the Data Grids in three ways:
 
1. Reviewing whether any dataset on HDX could be added to a Data Grid;
 
2. Conducting targeted outreach with humanitarian organizations to find relevant datasets; and
 
3. Identifying potential datasets with partners in the research community, academia and/or government   
                 agencies. 
The first step in determining whether a dataset should be included in a Data Grid is to check whether the dataset 
meets this thematic requirement defined in Annex A. Datasets that are not considered relevant are automatically 
excluded.
The second step is to determine if the dataset is sub-national. To fulfil this requirement the data must be 
disaggregated to at least the first administrative division. If the data is only available at the national level, it is 
typically excluded. The sub-national requirement has been partially or completely waived for three datasets: 
UNHCR’s data on forcibly displaced populations and stateless persons; OCHA FTS’s requirements and funding 
data; and IATI activities data. For information about the decision-making process for sub-national waivers, see 
Annex C.
The third step is to assess whether a thematically relevant, sub-national data set is complete or incomplete. A 
dataset is considered complete if it satisfies all of the following criteria: 
 
1. Broad geographic coverage;
 
2. Available in commonly used formats; and
 
3. Timely (full definitions are given below).
If the dataset does not satisfy one or more of these criteria, it is considered incomplete. 
Finally, the dataset is compared against existing datasets for that location to determine if it should be added to 
the Data Grid. If the sub-category is empty, or if the data would complement other datasets in a sub-category, the 
HDX team will add it to the Data Grid. A complementary dataset is one that adds unique and useful information to 
the sub-category.
The IATI datasets are a good example of a complementary dataset as they add unique and useful information to 
the 3W sub-category. Another example is a dataset that provides data for a geographic area not covered by the 
existing dataset. If there is already a complete dataset available for the sub-category, the HDX team will reach out 
to in-country partners to determine which dataset is being used operationally and that dataset will be included in 
the Data Grid.
The sub-category is considered complete if it has at least one complete dataset available for the sub-category. If 
the sub-category contains only incomplete datasets, then that sub-category is considered incomplete. Overall 
category completeness refers to the proportion of sub-categories in the category that are complete. Similarly, 
completeness for a location refers to the proportion of sub-categories that are complete in the location.
Sub-categories are considered empty if no datasets on HDX meet the above-mentioned criteria. In general, data 
can be missing for three reasons:

1. It is not collected (e.g., because nobody is present to do so, because it is unsafe to access areas to collect 
                 it, because it requires investment and resources that are not available, or because nobody prioritizes it as   
                 a gap to fill); 
 
2. It is collected but not publicly shared (e.g. because the collecting organization does not have an open  
                 data policy, because the data is sensitive and should not be shared, because the collecting entity fears 
                 sharing the data with actors they do not know and trust, or because of a lack of resources to clean and 
                 share it);
 
3. It is collected and shared but is not shared on HDX, or known about by the HDX team.
DETAILED COMPLETENESS CRITERIA
The criteria for evaluating completeness for relevant, sub-national data are detailed below:
Does the data have broad geographic coverage with explicit location information?
             •  Is the dataset geographically comprehensive, or as comprehensive as possible? If the dataset is  
                disaggregated by administrative divisions, does it cover all of them? If it does not, is the meaning of a  
                missing administrative division defined in the metadata? If there is no comprehensive list to compare 
                against (for example, with spontaneous displacement locations), does the dataset make it clear if it 
                attempts to be comprehensive or not? 
             •  Are location references defined? The dataset should contain explicit geographic data (i.e., Geographic 
                Information System data or tabular data with latitude and longitude fields). If not, the dataset should be 
                joinable to an available dataset that defines those locations.
Is the data in commonly-used formats?
             •  Is it stored in a common file format? We include CSV, XLS, XLSX, SHP, GEOJSON, etc. Formats like GPKG   
                and others that are more diﬀicult for the typical humanitarian data specialist would be marked  
                ‘incomplete’.
             •  Is the data tidy? Field names and data rows should be easy to determine. There should not be sub-total 
                rows interspersed with data rows. The required data for the category should be in a single table on the 
                same tab. For tabular data with coordinates, the x and y columns (usually longitude and latitude) should 
                be in decimal degree format and separated into two columns.
Is the data timely?
             •  Has the dataset become out of date? Depending on how frequently the dataset is expected to be 
                updated, the HDX team considers the age of the data and whether the dataset should have been 
                superseded.

ANNEX C: CHANGES TO THE DATA GRIDS
A consistent focus of our work over the last year has been soliciting feedback from OCHA field oﬀices and partner 
organizations to ensure that the data requirements and criteria used to curate the Data Grids reflect data needs in 
humanitarian operations.
We established an internal Data Grid Governance Group to discuss feedback and improvements and make 
decisions around changes to the Data Grids. In 2021, the Data Grid Governance Group met three times and 
approved the following changes:
1. Crowdsourced data may be considered complete on a case-by-case basis. 
Previously, all crowdsourced datasets were automatically considered incomplete because this data collection 
methodology makes it diﬀicult to determine how up-to-date and comprehensive the data is. The Data Grid 
Governance Group determined that crowdsourced data would be considered complete if an OCHA field oﬀice 
confirms that the data is the best available and is being used operationally.
2. HDX Connect datasets can be included in the Data Grids and considered complete if they have been 
reviewed by the HDX team. 
HDX Connect is a feature that enables organizations to share metadata only and make the underlying data 
available by request. This ensures that organizations can verify who can access the data in sensitive contexts. The 
Data Grid Governance Group determined that as long as the HDX team has reviewed the dataset and assessed it 
against the criteria for inclusion in the Data Grids, that data can be considered complete.
3. Sub-categories were merged or removed.
The Data Grid Governance Group reviewed all sub-categories and the data within them, and agreed to the 
following changes:
 
a. The humanitarian profile locations sub-category was merged into the internally displaced persons  
 
 
     sub-category and the definition was updated to encompass elements of both. 
 
b. The baseline population by sex and age was merged into the baseline population sub-category and the  
  
  definition was updated to require sex and age dissaggregation. 
 
c. GAM and SAM were merged into a new acute malnutrition sub-category. This new sub-category can be  
  
      satisfied with data specifying either GAM or SAM rates. 
 
d. The sub-categories for casualties, aﬀected schools, and damaged and destroyed buildings were removed  
 
     due to a lack of relevance across all locations. They were therefore not a consistent measure for  
 
 
     humanitarian data availability.
4. Waiver of sub-national requirement for inclusion in the Data Grid.
The UNHCR data on forcibly displaced populations and stateless persons was previously excluded from the 
refugees and persons of concern sub-category because it was not sub-national. We received feedback that 
because refugee status is based on crossing national borders, refugee statistics are typically available and used at 
the national rather than sub-national level. The Data Grid Governance Group determined that this data is the best 
available and granted a waiver to include it as complete for the sub-category. A similar sub-national waiver is in 
place for the OCHA FTS requirements and funding data, since it is considered the best available, and for the IATI 
aid activities datasets, which are assessed as incomplete but considered a complimentary dataset to the 3W.
5. Creation of a ‘Not Applicable’ assessment.  
The Data Grid Governance Group agreed to allow ‘Not Applicable’ to be used when the sub-category is not 
relevant in a given context. This was applied to the following locations and sub-categories: Ukraine - acute 
malnutrition; Ukraine - refugees and persons of concern; Ukraine - returnees; and State of Palestine - returnees.
