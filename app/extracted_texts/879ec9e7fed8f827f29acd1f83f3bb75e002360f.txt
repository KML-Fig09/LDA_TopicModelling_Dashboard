1. INTRODUCTION
The Centre for Humanitarian Data   centre.humdata.org    |    Join our mailing list   bit.ly/humdatamailing    |    Twitter   @humdata    |    Email   centrehumdata@un.org 
In our fourth year of producing , we can report the highest levels yet for data 
availability across priority humanitarian operations. These gains can be attributed to the commitment of 
organizations to sharing and maintaining their data publicly. There was also strong demand for data about the 
world’s largest humanitarian crises, from the war in Ukraine to drought and food insecurity in the Horn of Africa. 
Our understanding of data availability and use comes from managing the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), an 
open platform for finding and sharing data across crises and organizations.1 In 2022, HDX was used by 1.5 million 
people in 233 countries and territories, an increase of 8 percent compared with 2021. Organizations added 3,700 
new and updated datasets, bringing the total to more than 20,400 datasets, which were downloaded over 1.8 
million times. Although HDX includes data about all countries in the world, we concentrate here on 25 locations 
with humanitarian response plans (HRPs).2 In 2022, 32 percent of all datasets downloaded from HDX were 
related to an HRP location.3 
At the start of 2023, we estimate that 73 percent of relevant, complete crisis data is available across 25 
humanitarian operations, based on the analysis of the HDX Data Grids (see criteria below). If we add the data that 
is relevant but incomplete, the total is 93 percent. This leaves 7 percent of categories with data that does not 
meet the criteria or with no data. The 25 Data Grids include 459 unique datasets, with a range of 13-22 datasets 
per location.
https://data.humdata.org/ 
HRPs are prepared by UN Humanitarian Country Teams in locations where there is an ongoing humanitarian emergency. HRPs are generally 
prepared annually, and outline an overall strategy and specific activities for each humanitarian cluster or sector.
We use Mixpanel, a third-party analytics service, to understand the behavior of users on the HDX platform. We do not send identifying information 
to Mixpanel.

This report contains details on the data available for each location, category and sub-category covered in the Data 
Grids as of 31 December 2022. It includes a country deep-dive for South Sudan and showcases the work of the 
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) on community mapping. It also provides examples of how climate 
impact data is being used to predict the impacts of a hazard on lives and livelihoods and trigger actions to 
mitigate them.

The HDX Data Grids narrow the focus within each HRP location to a limited set of foundational data needed to 
understand a humanitarian context. They provide a comparable way to assess data availability across locations and 
categories and are the basis for the analysis in this report. 
The Data Grids include six categories: aﬀected people; coordination and context; food security and nutrition; 
geography and infrastructure; health and education; and population and socio-economy. (See Annex A for definitions.)

Data may be included in a Data Grid if it is relevant to the category and sub-national. The data is considered ‘complete’ 
if it has broad geographic coverage, is shared in a commonly used format, and is up-to-date. If any of those criteria are 
not met, then it is considered ‘incomplete’. The sub-category is complete if it includes at least one dataset that is 
complete. If the sub-category contains only incomplete datasets, then that sub-category is considered incomplete. A 
sub-category is empty if no data meets the above criteria or the data does not exist on HDX. (See Annex B for the Data 
Grid criteria and curation process.)
 
In 2022, HDX maintained Data Grids for 25 locations and 20 sub-categories. The number of locations decreased by two 
from 2021 given that Zimbabwe and Pakistan no longer had humanitarian response plans in 2022. Two sub-categories 
were removed – transportation status and aﬀected areas – and one was added for climate impact. (See Annex C for 
changes to the Data Grids.)
We recognize the valuable contributions of all data-sharing organizations publishing data on HDX, and in 
particular the 18 organizations that populate the Data Grids, with reference to 175 data sources. Datasets 
included in the Data Grids are downloaded almost five times more than the average dataset on HDX.4 Trusted 
partnerships and focused advocacy efforts have led to many new or updated datasets in the Data Grids this year, 
including: 
    • Global malnutrition prevalence rates disaggregated by province in Afghanistan, contributed by OCHA 
Afghanistan and sourced to UNICEF.5
    • The number of displaced people by sub-prefecture in the Central African Republic (CAR), validated by the 
Commission des Mouvements de Population and shared by OCHA CAR.6
    • The impact of floods with disruption to aﬀected populations, destroyed infrastructure and vegetation in Niger, 
contributed by OCHA Niger and sourced to the Ministère de l'Action Humanitaire et de la Gestion des 
Catastrophes du Niger.7
    • Education facilities by type and location in Somalia, compiled by UNICEF and contributed by OCHA Somalia.8
    • Sub-national sex and age disaggregated population statistics for Sudan with updated projections for 2022, 
contributed by UNFPA and sourced to the Central Bureau of Statistics for Sudan.9
There were dozens of high-value datasets available on HDX throughout 2022 that go beyond the scope of the
Data Grids. A few examples include:
    • The list of voyages completed under the Black Sea Grain Initiative since August 2022, compiled and shared by 
the Joint Coordination Centre.¹⁰
    • Acute food insecurity estimates, cross-border trade and staple food prices for 37 countries, shared by the 
Famine Early Warning Systems Network.
    • Historical typhoon impact data covering the number of people aﬀected and homes damaged from 2014 to 
2020 in the Philippines, compiled and shared by the Netherlands Red Cross.
    • High-resolution population density maps and demographic estimates and the Facebook Social 
Connectedness Index, covering dozens of countries and shared by Meta.

2. KEY MESSAGES
   • The availability of core data for priority humanitarian operations is at its highest levels in the past four years, 
but gaps remain with climate impact data, acute malnutrition prevalence and access constraints, among 
other areas. 
   • Since 2019, when the Data Grids were first introduced on HDX, we have seen an increase in data completeness 
from 54 percent to 73 percent in locations with humanitarian response plans. The categories with no data 
have fallen from 25 percent to 7 percent (see chart below). 
   • These gains can be attributed to the strong commitment of organizations to sharing and maintaining their 
data publicly through the HDX platform. 
   • There was strong demand for data about the world’s largest humanitarian crises, from the war in Ukraine to 
drought and food insecurity in the Horn of Africa. Data covering Ukraine, Ethiopia and Nigeria was the most 
downloaded in 2022. 
   • In 2022, HDX was used by 1.5 million people in 233 countries and territories. Around 1.8 million datasets were 
downloaded throughout the year.
   • We estimate that 73 percent of relevant, complete crisis data is available across 25 locations with 
humanitarian operations, based on the analysis of the HDX Data Grids. If we add the data that is relevant but 
incomplete, the total is 93 percent. This leaves about 7 percent of the Data Grids with no data.
   • Over two dozen new organizations joined HDX in 2022, bringing the total to almost 300 organizations. 
Eighteen organizations contribute data that is included in the Data Grids.
   • The 25 Data Grids included 459 unique datasets, with a range of 13-22 datasets per location. Datasets included 
in the Data Grids are downloaded almost five times more than the average dataset on HDX.
   • South Sudan, Afghanistan and Somalia have the most complete Data Grids. Venezuela, Syria and Libya are the 
countries with the largest data gaps.
   • The most complete Data Grid sub-categories are funding, administrative divisions, baseline population, IDPs, 
refugees and persons of concern, and food prices, owing to the work of OCHA, UNFPA, IOM, UNHCR, and WFP.
   • Humanitarian crises are dynamic and so is the data needed to understand them. The availability and 
completeness of data will fluctuate year-to-year as new data requirements come into focus.
   • A priority for 2023 will be a continued focus on climate impact data, which is essential for understanding and 
predicting the future impacts of hazards on vulnerable populations. We will also explore implementing data 
quality grades or scores for some datasets included in the Data Grids.

We call on partners to generate and share data that is missing or incomplete for many humanitarian crises, 
including:
   • Access constraints on the delivery of humanitarian assistance (potential sources: national governments, 
access working groups, OCHA).
   • Climate impact data covering the previous 10 years of hazards and their impact on people, infrastructure and 
vegetation (potential sources: national governments, disaster risk management agencies, humanitarian 
partners).
   • Global acute malnutrition prevalence rates by administrative division (potential sources: UNICEF, the Nutrition 
Cluster).
   • The location of airports (potential sources: aviation authorities, national governments, the Logistics Cluster, 
WFP).
   • The location of education facilities (potential sources: national governments, UNICEF, UNESCO, the Education 
Cluster).
   • The location of health facilities (potential sources: national governments, the Health Cluster, WHO).
In cases where data is sensitive, organizations can use HDX Connect     to share only the metadata and make the 
underlying data available by request. Alternatively, an incomplete or aggregated version of the dataset that 
removes sensitive information (such as locations) can be shared publicly.

By the end of 2022, there were improvements in data availability across location, category and sub-category. Six 
countries – Afghanistan, CAR, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan – no longer have any sub-categories with 
missing data, although some data remains incomplete in geographic coverage or frequency. The geography and 
infrastructure category become more complete with data added on populated places for a number of countries. 
Overall, the sub-categories with no data decreased from 11 percent to 7 percent year on year.

South Sudan (100 percent), Afghanistan (95 percent) and Somalia (90 percent) are the countries with the highest 
levels of data completeness. The next most-complete locations for data are the Central African Republic 
(85 percent) and Mali (85 percent).
Venezuela (40 percent of the sub-categories with no data), Syria (20 percent of the sub-categories with no data) 
and Libya (15 percent of the sub-categories with no data) are the countries with the largest data gaps. 
The most complete categories are population and socio-economy (94 percent), aﬀected people (86 percent) and 
food security and nutrition (81 percent). Health and education is the least complete category at 46 percent, owing 
to incomplete data for the location of health and education facilities. The most popular category, in terms of total 
dataset downloads, is geography and infrastructure.
A total of 459 unique datasets are included in the 25 Data Grids. Each Data Grid includes between 13 to 22 datasets.

6. COMPLETENESS BY LOCATION AND SUB-CATEGORY
The most complete sub-categories are funding, administrative divisions and baseline population (all at 100 
percent) followed by IDPs, refugees and persons of concern, and food prices (all at 96 percent), owing to the 
contributions of OCHA, UNFPA, IOM, UNHCR and WFP. Education facilities (32 percent), airports (36 percent) and 
humanitarian access (40 percent) are the most challenging sub-categories to complete.

This view of the Data Grids also shows where data is consistently shared across all locations but is considered 
incomplete. This is the case for conflict events data (political violence, civilian-targeting and demonstrations) 
which is shared on a weekly basis for each country. As of June 2023, ACLED made subnational conflict data at the 
second administrative division (Admin2) level for countries with an active humanitarian response plan available 
for direct download on HDX. The addition of these subnational data files, updated weekly, make the conflict 
events subcategory 100 percent complete as of June 2023, which should be reflected in next year's report. All 
disaggregated event-level conflict data remain publicly accessible through the ACLED website.

There has been steady progress with the South Sudan Data Grid over the past year owing to the engagement of 
the OCHA Country Oﬀice and humanitarian partners. South Sudan became the first location to reach 100 percent 
completeness, up from 76 percent complete last year. 
The Data Grid includes 20 unique datasets shared by nine organizations. Together, these datasets were 
downloaded 8,348 times in 2022. The most popular dataset was the administrative boundaries for the country. 
Another sought-afer dataset was the number of people aﬀected by flooding, by state and county, over the 
previous two years, which is included in the climate impact sub-category.

8. ORGANIZATION DEEP-DIVE: 
HUMANITARIAN OPENSTREETMAP TEAM
The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, known by its acronym HOT, supports humanitarian action and 
community development through open mapping. When disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT is able to 
mobilize thousands of volunteers who come together online and on the ground to create open data that enables 
disaster responders to reach those in need.
The data is derived from a crowdsourcing model that leverages OpenStreetMap (OSM), a free, open source, 
editable map of the world. The data is contributed to OSM in one of three ways:
    • In-person, mobile data collection that is focused on the location of specific infrastructure, such as education 
      and health facilities.
    • Remote sensing and digitization from satellite imagery or unmanned aerial vehicles to create building and 
       road datasets.
    • Importing existing datasets from governments and organizations.
Given their commitment to open source data and tools, HOT became one of the first organizations to join HDX 
when it launched in 2014. Since then, they have added over 4,400 datasets covering 249 countries and territories, 
which currently accounts for about 20 percent of all data on HDX. The data includes the essential ingredients for 
map making: road networks; populated places; airport, railways and port locations; education and health 
facilities; and rivers and waterways. These details are critical for humanitarians to understand the physical 
geography and infrastructure of a country, and this data is consistently among the most downloaded on HDX. 
The humanitarian open mapping community, which is currently estimated to be around 423,000 people from 
around the world,   is continuously updating the data on OpenStreetMap. The HOT and HDX teams realized early 
on that it would be impossible to keep the datasets on HDX up-to-date without an automated process. In 2016, 
we worked together to build an extension to the HOT Export Tool – called the HOT Bot   – which sends the data to 
HDX on a regular cycle. This eliminates the complex task of configuring a custom export in the HOT Export Tool 
and pre-packages the data in common GIS data formats broken down by country and region. 
The datasets exported by HOT are included in the Data Grids if they are deemed to be the best available source for 
a sub-category. This determination is made by the HDX team in collaboration with the Information Management 
Working Group in each country. In 2022, data attributed to HOT was included in the Data Grids for nine countries 
covering three sub-categories – airports, populated places and roads.

This includes:
    • Afghanistan (airports, populated places, roads) 
    • Burkina Faso (roads)
    • Burundi (populated places, roads)
    • Cameroon (roads)
    • Central African Republic (roads)
    • Democratic Republic of the Congo (roads)
    • Libya (roads)
    • Niger (roads) 
    • Ukraine (roads)
Open mapping data is not included in the Data Grids in cases when it is too sensitive to share (e.g., the location of 
health facilities in an active conflict), or when there is a more complete version of the data available from an 
oﬀicial source. 
For HOT, data quality is a primary concern. Additions and improvements are contributed by a large number of 
partners in the humanitarian and development space, as well as commercial partners using OSM data in their 
workflows and products. To complement existing data validation, HOT and HDX are working to provide additional 
insights into factors such as data accuracy and completeness. 
In 2022, the data exported by HOT to HDX was downloaded almost 67,000 times by users in 194 countries and 
territories. Road network data for Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Pakistan were among the most popular. Datasets 
shared by HOT will continue to be in high demand at the onset of a new crisis, providing first responders with the 
geographical awareness that is essential for humanitarian action. 
We are grateful to Humanitarian OpenStreetMap for being a steadfast data sharing partner. Visit their site    to

Out of the 293 organizations    sharing data on HDX, 18 contribute data that is included in the Data Grids, with 
reference to 175 data sources. These 18 organizations are consistently among the top organizations on HDX with 
the most datasets downloaded. OCHA is counted as a single organization even though over 30 field oﬀices    and 
two entities at Headquarters contribute data to HDX. In total, OCHA field oﬀices contributed 214 datasets or 43 
percent of all data in the Data Grids.

An organization on HDX can be a legal entity or an informal group and may be listed as the source or the contributor of the dataset. The entities listed in 
this section have created organizations on HDX and manage their data directly. Although most organizations are both the source and contributor for the 
data, there are cases where this varies. For instance, as part of its coordination role, OCHA aggregates and shares data on humanitarian needs but the data 
is collected by multiple partners.

10. CLIMATE IMPACT DATA
The Centre for Humanitarian Data   centre.humdata.org    |    Join our mailing list   bit.ly/humdatamailing    |    Twitter   @humdata    |    Email   centrehumdata@un.org 
The most significant change to the Data Grids in 2022 was the inclusion of a new sub-category for climate impact 
data. This data should contain the current and historical impacts of climate events relating to floods, droughts 
and storms, as well as their location, date and impact on aﬀected populations, infrastructure and/or vegetation. 
By the end of the year, this sub-category was 68 percent complete with data missing for seven countries with 
humanitarian operations.
With the climate crisis intensifying emergencies around the world, humanitarians are increasingly having to 
incorporate climate data and forecasts into their analysis and planning. This is especially the case for anticipatory 
action, which relies on models to predict the impacts of a hazard on lives and livelihoods and trigger actions to 
mitigate them. 
Since 2019, the Centre has supported OCHA’s anticipatory action pilots for various hazards in twelve countries. 
This has ranged from drought in Chad and Somalia to floods in Nepal and Bangladesh. Our technical support 
involves conducting historical analysis of the hazard and its impact, assessing available models and forecasts, 
and designing trigger mechanisms for the release of funds. By the end of 2022, the UN Central Emergency 
Response Fund had released $89 million    in funding for anticipatory action based on trigger mechanisms 
developed by the Centre and OCHA oﬀices.
Three types of climate data are used to build, evaluate and validate trigger mechanisms:
 
    •  data on what happened (the hazard)
    •  data on the damage (the impact)
    •  data on what is likely to happen next (the forecast)
The data that is most ofen missing for this analysis is the impact data. Without it, we are not able to model the 
expected impacts of future shocks.
As an example, in Niger we used household survey data to understand the impact of seasonal rainfall levels on 
livelihoods. Once we understood this, we were able to use seasonal rainfall forecasts to inform humanitarian 
partners about the likely impact of a below average season. Similarly, in the Philippines    we worked with the 
Netherlands Red Cross to use historical typhoon track and rainfall data to train a model that estimates housing 
damage caused by typhoons. This model is now being used to estimate the expected impact based on typhoon 
forecasts provided by meteorological institutions. A historical typhoon impact dataset,    covering 2014 to 2020, 
is now available on HDX.
By the end of 2022, eighteen climate impact datasets had been added to HDX and the Data Grids, in collaboration 
with OCHA oﬀices and partners. A few examples include:  
    • Mozambique: Data on the number of people aﬀected by cyclones at the district level from 2016 to 2022, shared 
       by OCHA Mozambique and produced by Instituto Nacional de Gestão e Redução do Risco de Desastres.
    • Mali: Data on the number of people aﬀected, houses destroyed, water and sanitation infrastructure damaged 
       and livestock lost as the results of seasonal floods, shared and maintained by OCHA Mali.
    • Burundi: Data on the impact from floods and heavy rains on populations, infrastructure and/or vegetation, 
       shared by IOM via OCHA Burundi.

The $89 million has been allocated for drought in Niger, Somalia and Ethiopia; for flooding in Bangladesh, South Sudan and Nepal; and for 
cholera in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

11. CONCLUSION
BURUNDI: CLIMATE IMPACT TRENDS 2018-2022
Beyond the Data Grids, we are also looking to make a wider set of climate data more accessible to the HDX 
community. For example, WFP recently shared earth observation datasets    on rainfall and vegetation health
covering 33 countries with either a humanitarian response plan or an anticipatory action framework. With this 
data, humanitarians can assess current drought conditions and also analyze historical trends to anticipate the 
impact of rainy seasons.
Despite this progress, climate impact data remains scarce for certain types of climate shocks and locations and 
the historical time period is ofen limited. In the year ahead, we plan to share practical guidance on how to 
interpret and use common forecasts, such as seasonal rainfall forecasts or riverine flood projections. And we are 
developing tools    to make it easier for humanitarians to use climate data.

We will continue to update the Data Grids throughout the year as organizations share new, relevant data. The 
current status for each location is always available on HDX, both on the relevant location page and on the 
Overview of Data Grids page.    As part of our internal Data Grid Governance Group, we will regularly review the 
categories and sub-categories to see if they should be removed or expanded. 
A priority for 2023 will be a continued focus on climate impact data, which is essential for understanding and 
predicting the future impacts of hazards on vulnerable populations. We will also explore implementing data 
quality grades or scores for some datasets included in the Data Grids.
We welcome feedback on possible improvements. Please be in touch with questions or comments at 
centrehumdata@un.org.

ANNEX B: INCLUSION OF DATA IN THE DATA GRIDS
Data Grid curation involves the careful evaluation of datasets on HDX for inclusion in one or more of the 
sub-categories in accordance with our standard criteria. The HDX team conducts this evaluation when a dataset is 
newly added or updated on HDX. 
The HDX team supports the Data Grids in three ways:
 
1. Reviewing whether any dataset on HDX could be added to a Data Grid;
 
2. Conducting targeted outreach with humanitarian organizations to find relevant datasets; and
 
3. Identifying potential datasets with partners in the research community, academia and/or government   
                 agencies. 
The first step in determining whether a dataset should be included in a Data Grid is to check whether the dataset 
meets the thematic requirement defined in Annex A. Datasets that are not considered relevant are automatically 
excluded.
The second step is to determine if the dataset is sub-national. To fulfill this requirement the data must be 
disaggregated to at least the first administrative division. If the data is only available at the national level, it is 
typically excluded. The sub-national requirement has been partially or completely waived for three datasets: 
UNHCR’s data on forcibly displaced populations and stateless persons; OCHA FTS’s requirements and funding 
data; and IATI activities data.
The third step is to assess whether a thematically relevant, sub-national data set is complete or incomplete. A 
dataset is considered complete if it satisfies all of the following criteria: 
 
1. Broad geographic coverage;
 
2. Available in commonly used formats; and
 
3. Timely (full definitions are given below).
If the dataset does not satisfy one or more of these criteria, it is considered incomplete. 
Finally, the dataset is compared against existing datasets for that location to determine if it should be added to 
the Data Grid. If the sub-category is empty, or if the data would complement other datasets in a sub-category, the 
HDX team will add it to the Data Grid. A complementary dataset is one that adds unique and useful information to 
the sub-category.
The IATI datasets are a good example of a complementary dataset as they add unique and useful information to 
the 3W sub-category. Another example is a dataset that provides data for a geographic area not covered by the 
existing dataset. If there is already a complete dataset available for the sub-category, the HDX team will reach out 
to in-country partners to determine which dataset is being used operationally and that dataset will be included in 
the Data Grid.
The sub-category is considered complete if it has at least one complete dataset available for the sub-category. If 
the sub-category contains only incomplete datasets, then that sub-category is considered incomplete. Overall 
category completeness refers to the proportion of sub-categories in the category that are complete. Similarly, 
completeness for a location refers to the proportion of sub-categories that are complete in the location.
Sub-categories are considered empty if no datasets on HDX meet the above-mentioned criteria. In general, data 
can be missing for three reasons:

1. It is not collected (e.g., because nobody is present to do so, because it is unsafe to access areas to collect 
                 it, because it requires investment and resources that are not available, or because nobody prioritizes it   
                 as a gap to fill). 
 
2. It is collected but not publicly shared (e.g., because the collecting organization does not have an open  
                 data policy, because the data is sensitive and should not be shared, because the collecting entity fears 
                 sharing the data with actors they do not know and trust, or because of a lack of resources to clean and 
                 share it).
 
3. It is collected and shared but is not shared on HDX, or known about by the HDX team.
DETAILED COMPLETENESS CRITERIA
The criteria for evaluating completeness for relevant, sub-national data are detailed below:
Does the data have broad geographic coverage with explicit location information?
             •  Is the dataset geographically comprehensive, or as comprehensive as possible? If the dataset is  
                disaggregated by administrative divisions, does it cover all of them? If it does not, is the meaning of a  
                missing administrative division defined in the metadata? If there is no comprehensive list to compare 
                against (for example, with spontaneous displacement locations), does the dataset make it clear if it 
                attempts to be comprehensive or not? 
             •  Are location references defined? The dataset should contain explicit geographic data (i.e., Geographic 
                Information System data or tabular data with latitude and longitude fields). If not, the dataset should be 
                joinable to an available dataset that defines those locations.
Is the data in commonly-used formats?
             •  Is it stored in a common file format? We include CSV, XLS, XLSX, SHP, GEOJSON, etc. Formats like GPKG   
                and others that are more diﬀicult for the typical humanitarian data specialist would be marked  
                ‘incomplete.’
             •  Is the data tidy? Field names and data rows should be easy to determine. There should not be sub-total 
                rows interspersed with data rows. The required data for the category should be in a single table on the 
                same tab. For tabular data with coordinates, the x and y columns (usually longitude and latitude) should 
                be in decimal degree format and separated into two columns.
Is the data timely?
             •  Has the dataset become out of date? Depending on how frequently the dataset is expected to be 
                updated, the HDX team considers the age of the data and whether the dataset should have been 
                superseded.

ANNEX C: CHANGES TO THE DATA GRIDS
Over the last year, we have continued to solicit feedback from OCHA field oﬀices and our partners to ensure that 
the sub-category definitions and curation criteria reflect data needs in humanitarian operations. The Data Grid 
Governance Group discusses the feedback that we receive and makes decisions around changes to the Data 
Grids.
In 2022, the Data Grid Governance Group met three times and approved the following changes:
1) Adding a sub-category for climate impact 
We expanded the Data Grids to include a new sub-category for climate impact which covers current and historical 
hazards and their impact on people, infrastructure and/or vegetation. Read more about this decision in our blog 
post from November 2022.
2) Removing sub-categories for transportation status and aﬀected areas 
 
a. Transportation status: The diﬀerence between the transportation status and roads sub-categories was   
                 ofen unclear. In more than 35 percent of locations, the same dataset was used for both sub-categories. 
 
b. Aﬀected areas: The definition for the aﬀected areas sub-category focused on the type and/or severity of 
                 geographical impacts. This was interpreted diﬀerently across locations, making it an inconsistent 
                 measure for data availability. When the sub-category was complete, it was a mix of data on the impact of 
                 climate events and the severity estimates included in a Humanitarian Needs Overview dataset.
