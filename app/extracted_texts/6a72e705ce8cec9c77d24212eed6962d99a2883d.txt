Innovating Anticipatory Action: 
Lessons from the 2022 South 
Sudan Floods
1 OCHA, South Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan, 2022.
More reliable weather and vulnerability forecast-
ing means there is more opportunity than in past 
decades to limit the humanitarian impact of certain 
shocks. Taking action in advance of a crisis, before 
either the shock or its peak impact, is known in the 
humanitarian sector as anticipatory action. In es-
sence, anticipatory action makes acting the default 
when risks, not needs, increase.
A predictive model or forecast that can be used to 
trigger pre-agreed action plans and pre-arranged 
finance is at the heart of anticipatory action. Ideally, 
all these elements can be captured in a single 
framework document that serves as a ‘rulebook’ 
for how anticipatory action is supposed to work 
for a specific shock, in a specific context. But what 
happens when there is insufficient forecast data 
available, or the complex operating environment 
in the country requires more time to prepare and 
respond? Is it still possible for the humanitarian 
community to be anticipatory and for the UN 
Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to 
release funds ahead of an impending crisis?
This was the situation facing South Sudan in 2022. 
Through creative thinking and the decision to pilot 
a new approach, the UN Office for the Coordination 
of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) discovered the 
answer is yes.
As Joyce Msuya, Assistant Secretary-General 
for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency 
Relief Coordinator concluded, “The takeaway is 
clear: anticipatory action works for climate-related 
shocks in South Sudan, but also elsewhere, includ-
ing in Mozambique as I saw during my recent visit. 
Government-OCHA collaboration on early warning, 
combined with proactive community engagement, 
saved lives and resources. This cost-effective, flexi-
ble approach helps minimize suffering.”
The challenge
At the beginning of 2022, communities across 
South Sudan were suffering from three years of 
unprecedented flooding. Floods had become a 
year-round struggle, exacerbating an already dire 
humanitarian situation, where more than two-thirds 
of the population (almost 9 million people) needed 
humanitarian assistance.1 Ongoing conflict and 
instability in the country combined with the flooding 
resulted in people being forced to leave their homes 
time and time again.
In March 2022, OCHA explored the feasibility of 
developing an Anticipatory Action Framework to 
get ahead and mitigate the impact of severe floods. 
OCHA’s Centre for Humanitarian Data explored the 
available data and forecasts that could be used to 
develop the trigger mechanism for a framework. 
However, the predictive strength of forecasts usual-
ly used to provide information on future large-scale 
flooding was limited for South Sudan.

The complex nature of the Sudd wetland’s ecosys-
tem meant that even where data was available and 
trends could be observed, there was no clear corre-
lation with flooding. With no forecast available that 
could provide a trigger for time-bound actions, an 
Anticipatory Action Framework would not be viable.
There was another challenge. Even if the data was 
available, traditional flood models typically forecast 
only 1 or 2 weeks ahead. In a complex operating 
environment like South Sudan, this may not provide 
humanitarian actors and communities with enough 
time to prepare. Many supply routes were already 
submerged from the 2021 floods making preposi-
tioning supplies difficult, time consuming, and fully 
dependent on air travel.
While the data infrastructure was inadequate to 
create a predictive model or forecast, the Centre’s 
analysis confirmed there was enough information 
to indicate a significant flood was looming.
Typically, during the dry season, flood waters retreat 
into the Nile and other river basins, drying out the 
land and preparing for a new rainy season. Howev-
er, the flood waters from 2021 never receded and 
remained above the highest levels observed in over 
20 years. Any new rains expected for 2022’s rainy 
season would turn an already dire situation disas-
torous.
As Seth Caldwell from OCHA’s Centre for Human-
itarian Data observed, “The water levels were be-
yond anything seen, and that was before the 2022 
rainy season had begun.”
In-country humanitarian and environmental experts 
agreed that even with a normal rainy season, there 
was extreme risk it would bring widespread floods 
beyond the levels seen in 2021 and likely at or 
beyond the scale of a 1 in 50-year event. Without 
intervention, such an event could lead to drastic lev-
els of need for affected populations, many of whom 
were already experiencing an extreme lack of food 
and had exhausted all coping mechanisms.

using AER Floodscan data.
In Unity State, the flooding was expected to put 
more than 320,000 people — over a third of whom 
were already displaced — at risk of further displace-
ment, loss of livelihoods, disease outbreaks, food 
insecurity and psychological distress.
Over 125,000 people living in the Bentiu internally 
displaced persons (IDP) camp and in informal 
camps in Bentiu town were particularly vulnerable 
and at risk. Since 2021, the Bentiu area had been 
surrounded by floodwater creating an island, cut 
off from dry land and roads, protected by kilome-
ters of hurriedly constructed dykes. Roads to bring 
relief items or evacuate people from flooded areas 
were inundated. With very limited opportunity for 
livelihoods and reduced access to aid, people were 
extremely food insecure — at times resorting to 
eating water lilies. Even a relatively small increase 
in the water level or a dike breach would have cata-
strophic impacts.
Not only was the Bentiu IDP camp at risk of being 
submerged, so was the site of Unity State’s human-
itarian operations. As an Inter-Cluster Coordination 
Group Member in Bentiu said, “If we get a quarter 
amount of the water that we currently have, we’re 
all not going to be here.”2

The solution
OCHA saw an opportunity. Pilot a lighter and nim-
bler approach to anticipatory action, where CERF 
allocations can be provided earlier in countries 
with protracted crises based on a high likelihood of 
that country experiencing an additional shock that 
would compound existing humanitarian needs.
Consequently, CERF did not need to wait for the 
floods to destroy the homes and lives of people in 
Bentiu. Instead, CERF pulled the response forward 
by allocating US$15 million, complemented by an 
additional $4 million from the South Sudan Human-
itarian Fund (SSHF) in May 2022, well ahead of the

2022 rainy season3 and months sooner than had 
been the case in response to the 2020 and 2021 
floods.
Alongside the funding, Sara Beysolow Nyanti, Resi-
dent and Humanitarian Coordinator in South Sudan, 
put in place decision-making as close to the people 
of Bentiu as possible. A high-level special task 
force was established with senior representatives 
in Bentiu to consult with communities on their pri-
orities and to oversee operations. The placement of 
the task force in Bentiu along with a public project 
tracker specific to the anticipatory action projects, 
generated urgency, timely decisions and accounta-
bility.4
Ahead of the October 2022 floods, partners used 
the funds to construct and reinforce over 55 kilom-
eters of dykes to protect vital access roads, homes 
and the airstrip. These dykes would prove to be 
critical, preventing 100,000 people from having to 
be evacuated and further displaced, even as IDP 
camps sank below water-level at the peak of the 
flooding.5 A previously flooded road between Bentiu 
and Mayom junction was reopened, providing a key 
supply route that increased the volume of supplies 
and was estimated to be four times cheaper than 
having to fly in supplies. Protection of the airstrip al-
lowed humanitarian operations to continue through-
out the rainy season — a lifeline for the people of 
Bentiu.

Early investments in latrines, water treatment sites, 
and cholera vaccine campaigns helped to avert a 
public health emergency, with the country able to 

6
maintain a case fatality rate from cholera of less 
than 1 percent.6
Cash transfers to over 1,000 female-headed house-
holds, the majority of whom had at least one family 
member who was elderly or with a mobility im-
pairment, enabled them to reinforce their shelters. 
Before the floods, at least 93 percent of households 
reported water entered their shelter when it rained. 
After making the investment in their shelters, this 
decreased to 42 percent in one camp and less than 
12 percent in the other two camps at the height of 
the rainy season.7
The early allocation of CERF and SSHF funds was 
catalytic. It rang the alarm bell, mobilizing earlier 
funding from donors and action from humanitarian 
partners.8

“On the whole the money that 
came in helped quite a bit with 
mitigation for flooding... 
Other locations in the camp set 
up dike committees and trained 
people immediately. Materials 
were bought, and tools, and 
people were able to use the tools 
to reduce flooding in their sites.”

The take-away
This example from South Sudan demonstrates that 
in protracted crises and conflict settings, where 
forecasting data is often less reliable, it is still 
possible for the humanitarian community to take 
anticipatory action based on risk and vulnerability.
Anticipatory action may work best when there 
is a framework with a pre-agreed trigger for pre-
arranged funding and activities. But sometimes 
there is not enough time, data, or access to develop 
such a framework. South Sudan shows this should 
not stop humanitarians from acting to mitigate the 
impact ahead of an expected shock. Anticipatory 
principles can be taken and adapted to context-
appropriate programmes.
South Sudan also illustrates that continuous 
learning and improvement is a bedrock for 
innovation.
As of 2 January 2024, OCHA has facilitated 
collective anticipatory action pilots in 19 countries 
over three years, releasing some $90 million in 
funding.
“The pilots helped the humanitarian community 
to learn what works and what doesn’t. They 
contributed to a mind shift in the humanitarian 
community, creating a higher level of understanding 
and acceptance for acting ahead of a predictable 
or forecasted shock. Senior leaders and donors 
trust the analysis provided by the Centre and 
the pilots have given them more confidence to 
make decisions and fund based on risk,” said 
Lisa Doughten, Director of OCHA’s Financing and 
Partnership Division.
OCHA continues to facilitate coordinated 
anticipatory action and has expanded its portfolio 
of pre-arranged funding to more than $100 million 
in 15 countries for storms, floods, droughts and 
cholera.

CERF is also inviting applications for funding 
anticipatory action to get ahead of predictable 
humanitarian impacts of El-Niño-driven climate 
emergencies.“With an overstretched global system, 
scaling up anticipatory action remains a top priority 
for OCHA. This involves advancing analysis on 
the approach and the related opportunity costs,” 
said Joyce Msuya, Assistant Secretary-General for 
Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief 
Coordinator.
OCHA’s Centre for Humanitarian Data is also build-
ing on valuable lessons from South Sudan, expand-
ing its work on risk analysis to support early action 
in other contexts.
To translate technical information into actionable in-
formation for humanitarians, the Centre is expand-
ing its work on flood anticipatory action. In partner-
ship with Google’s Flood Forecasting Initiative, the 
Centre is piloting flood early warning across the 
Niger and Benue river systems to provide automat-
ic alerts to decision makers when flood levels are 
forecasted or observed to rise.
By linking analysis to decision makers and funding 
— like the CERF and implementing partners — OCHA 
10 E. Easton-Calabria, Acting in Advance of Flooding: Early Action in South Sudan, A Feinstein International Center Brief, 2023.
aims to continue to mobilize pre-arranged financing 
and resources for anticipatory or early action.
Overall, the humanitarian community considers the 
pilot in South Sudan a success, but with an acute 
awareness that anticipatory action by itself will 
never be enough.
By the end of the 2022 rainy season in South Sudan, 
several dykes had burst and homes that had been 
temporarily repaired were beginning to leak again. 
There is an urgent need for longer-term disaster risk 
reduction and development to support the people 
of South Sudan to endure these increasingly severe 
climatic events.
As observed by one humanitarian partner: “What 
we’re doing is mitigating the worst humanitarian im-
pact for people. But if we don’t have a real climate 
adaptation programme, where we really look at in-
frastructure, roads, dykes, and longer-term areas to 
protect, like water systems reinforced, we will con-
tinue to have massive humanitarian consequences…
Our action is meant to be limited in time, but here 
[in South Sudan] it is the only action taken.”10
For the people in Bentiu, that action was critical.
