RE:        Initiation of antidumping duty investigation of Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel from
Germany (A-428-842)
 
1.  On 10/31/2013, Commerce published in the Federal Register its initiation of the antidumping
duty investigation of Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel from Germany (78 FR 65283).
 
2.  The scope of this investigation covers grain-oriented silicon electrical steel (GOES).  GOES is a
flat-rolled alloy steel product containing by weight at least 0.6 percent but not more than 6 percent
of silicon, not more than 0.08 percent of carbon, not more than 1.0 percent of aluminum, and no
other element in an amount that would give the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel, in
coils or in straight lengths.  The GOES that is subject to this investigation is currently classifiable
under subheadings 7225.11.0000, 7226.11.1000, 7226.11.9030, and 7226.11.9060 of the
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).  Although the HTSUS subheadings are
provided for convenience and customs purposes, the written description of the scope of this
investigation is dispositive.
 
3.  This investigation has been assigned investigation number A-428-842.
